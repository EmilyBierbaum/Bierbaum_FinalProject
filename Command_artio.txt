##########trees files already formatted in Nexus after exported from phylogenetic analyses
########data files formatted in ASCII, animal names and their character states (D or G)
######double check the text file is in plain text, names are spelled correctly, and identical to names in the tree file


########## 1 for Multistate
########Multistate model of evolution reconstructs how traits that adopt a number of discrete states evolve on phylogenies
######it can also reconstruct ancestral states or test models of trait evolution
####(Pagel, Meade et al.)


########## 2 for MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo)
########approximates posterior distribution of a parameter of interest


########## AddTag AquaTag Porpoise Dolphin FKWhale Whale
########identifies a node 
######creates a tag with a unique name (AquaTag) with the list of taxa names that define that node
#####AquaTag defined by Porpoise, Dolphin, FKWhale, and Whale


########## AddNode CetaceaNode AquaTag
########reconstructs the tag or ancestral state in MultiState models
######reconstructs a node (CetaceaNode) in the output, and the name of a tag that defines the node
####Two new columns will be added: CetaceaNode P(D) and CetaceaNode P(G)
##displays the probability of reconstructing a D or a G at CetaceaNode


########## ScaleTrees
########no parameters required to set a mean branch length of 0.1 (what we did)
######can scale the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree by a given value (not what was done in this analysis)
####gets rid of the effect of different branch lengths; then the analysis will focus more on parsimony


########## Run
########BayesTraits performs the analyses 


########## two output files will be created (log and schedule)
########## refer to README file for troubleshooting
